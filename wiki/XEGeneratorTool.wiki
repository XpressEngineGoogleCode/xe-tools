= Introduction =

 Are you a developer interested in extending the native functionalities provided by XE? Well, this is the right place for you to start. This tool can be used by both types of developers: 
    * the ones that already have experience with XE
    * the ones that are just getting started using XE

 As you may know XE makes it very easy for developers to add functionality to the core code.  You can build _modules_ on top of the existing ones or write your own from scratch. Also, you can change the behavior of the existing modules by using _add-ons_ or insert snippets of code directly into pages using _widgets_.

 Basically this tool provides an easy way to start creating new modules, widgets and addons. For the developers that are new to XE it provides some demo versions that will help you to get started.


= Prerequisites =

 You need to have PHP 5.2.0 or newer installed. That’s pretty much it!

 There are also some PHP extensions (libxml and PHAR) required but usually these extensions are installed and enabled by default, so in most cases you should not worry about these extensions.

 _Note 1_: this tool does not require an XE installation on the same machine. But in order to test and use what this tool produces you need to have an XE installation.

 _Note 2_: if you want to build yourself the PHAR file for this tool you will need to have _Phing_ installed. But this is not mandatory because you can use an already built PHAR file or to use the raw files (not embedded everything in a PHP archive).

= Download and Run =

 This tool was created in PHP and should be executed from the PHP CLI (command line). So it works in the same way on all platforms (Unix, Windows, Mac).

 There are 3 possible ways to download the necessary files in order to be able to run the script:
  * download the PHAR (PHP archive)(like an executable file) from [http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fxe-tools%2Fdownloads%2Fdetail%3Fname%3Dxe-generator.phar here] (recommended)
  * download the ZIP archive from [http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fxe-tools%2Fdownloads%2Fdetail%3Fname%3Dxe-generator.zip here]
  * checkout the latest tool source code using the following command line:
      _svn checkout https://xe-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/generator generator_

 The PHAR files provides a way to put entire PHP applications into a single file called a "PHAR" (PHP Archive) for easy distribution and installation. So instead of downloading several files you can download a single one that contains everything. That’s why this method is the recommended one.

 In order to run the tool in the form of a PHAR file you should use the following command line:
  _php xe-generator.phar_
	
 If you prefer not using the PHAR method you should use the following command line (from the generator folder):
  _php xe-generator.php_
	
 Note: In case you prefer using the using the ZIP archive you should first unzip it in a folder (let’s say to a “generator” folder).
