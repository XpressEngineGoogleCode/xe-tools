#summary Tutorial on how to run the build configurations on Windows

= Introduction =

Prerequisites: phing should be installed (see [http://www.phing.info/trac/wiki/Users/Download]).

= Details =

After you have installed phing, you can check what build configuration (targets) are available by running:
{{{
phing -f <XML_filename> -l
}}}
To actually create the tar.gz and zip archives you need to call phing without the -l argument. It is recommended that you specify a build target. For example, for creating the XE Core release for global market the command is:
{{{
phing -f build-xe-en.xml xe_en -Dconfig.svn="C:\path_to_svn\svn.exe"
}}}
As you can see the path for svn is required, because the default is configured for a Linux environment.

Also, the build files contain commands for validating PHP syntax. In order to skip these you should comment the config.php4, config.php52 and config.php53 properties inside build-xe-en.xml.
